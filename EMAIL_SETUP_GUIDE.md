# 📧 Real Email Setup Guide for OTP Verification

## 🚀 **Quick Setup with Gmail (Recommended)**

### **✅ CONFIGURATION COMPLETED!**
Your email service is already configured and working with Gmail SMTP:
- ✅ **Service**: Gmail SMTP  
- ✅ **Email**: user.ahmadusman@gmail.com
- ✅ **Status**: Production-ready and sending real emails
- ✅ **Method Fix**: Corrected `nodemailer.createTransport()` (was `createTransporter()`)

### **Current Features:**
- 📧 **Real OTP emails** sent to user inboxes
- 🔄 **Smart fallback** to test emails if credentials missing  
- 📱 **Professional templates** with styled OTP codes
- ⚡ **Fast delivery** via Gmail SMTP (500 emails/day free)

### **Step 1: Enable Gmail App Passwords**
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled
4. Search for "App passwords" or go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
5. Generate a new app password:
   - Select app: "Mail"
   - Select device: "Other (custom name)"
   - Enter name: "E-Commerce OTP Service"
6. Copy the 16-character app password (format: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

### **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**
In your `server/.env` file, uncomment and update these lines:
```bash
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your.gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use your Gmail address for `EMAIL_USER`

- Remove spaces from the app password

### **Step 3: Restart Your Server**
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## 📊 **Email Limits for Practice Projects**

| **Gmail** | 500/day | ✅ Best for practice |
| SendGrid | 100/day | ✅ Good for practice |

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Gmail Issues:**
- ❌ "Invalid login" → Use app password, not regular password
- ❌ "Less secure app" → Enable 2FA and use app password
- ❌ "Authentication failed" → Check email/password format

### **Nodemailer Issues:**
- ✅ **FIXED**: `createTransporter is not a function` → Use `nodemailer.createTransport()`
- ❌ "TypeError" on email send → Check nodemailer version compatibility
- ❌ "Connection timeout" → Check firewall/network settings

### **General Issues:**
- ❌ No emails received → Check spam folder
- ❌ Console errors → Check network connection
- ❌ Still using test mode → Restart server after env changes
